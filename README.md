## Introduction
MagnetarMimir.Learning is designed to facilitate a smooth and comprehensive learning journey. It uses a level-based system (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2) to structure learning objectives and resources, ensuring learners can progress systematically from beginner to advanced topics in their chosen programming language.

Each sub-level focuses on a particular skill set or set of concepts, with corresponding markdown files providing detailed explanations and exercises.

## Learning Objectives
The objectives are categorized into levels and sub-levels for targeted learning:

| **Level**  | **Sub-Level** | **Learning Objectives**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | **Link**                     |
